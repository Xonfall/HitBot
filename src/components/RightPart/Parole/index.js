<h3>Parole</h3>
<p className='paroles'><span className='par'>[Video Intro]</span>
<span>Wicked or weakness?</span>
<span>You gotta see this</span>
<span>Waaaaay (yeah, yeah!)</span>

<span className='par'>[Album Intro]</span>
<span>Nobody pray for me</span>
<span>It's been that day for me</span>
<span>Waaaaay (yeah, yeah!)</span>

<span className='par'>[Verse 1]</span>
<span>Ayy, I remember syrup sandwiches and crime allowances</span>
<span>Finesse a nigga with some counterfeits, but now I’m countin' this</span>
<span>Parmesan where my accountant lives, in fact I'm downin’ this</span>
<span>D'USSÉ with my boo bae tastes like Kool-Aid for the analysts</span>
<span>Girl, I can buy yo' ass the world with my paystub</span>
<span>Ooh, that pussy good, won't you sit it on my taste bloods?</span>
<span>I get way too petty once you let me do the extras</span>
<span>Pull up on your block, then break it down: we playin' Tetris</span>
<span>A.M. to the P.M., P.M. to the A.M., funk</span>
<span>Piss out your per diem, you just gotta hate 'em, funk</span>
<span>If I quit your BM, I still ride Mercedes, funk</span>
<span>If I quit this season, I still be the greatest, funk</span>
<span>My left stroke just went viral</span>
<span>Right stroke put lil' baby in a spiral</span>
<span>Soprano C, we like to keep it on a high note</span>
<span>It's levels to it, you and I know</span>

<span className='par'>[Chorus]</span>
<span>Bitch, be humble (hol’ up, bitch)</span>
<span>Sit down (hol’ up, lil', hol’ up, lil' bitch)</span>
<span>Be humble (hol' up, bitch)</span>
<span>Sit down (hol' up, sit down, lil’, sit down, lil' bitch)</span>
<span>Be humble (hol' up, hol' up)</span>
<span>Bitch, sit down (hol' up, hol' up, lil' bitch)</span>
<span>Be humble (lil' bitch, hol' up, bitch)</span>
<span>Sit down (hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, hol' up)</span>
<span>Be humble (hol' up, hol' up)</span>
<span>Sit down (hol' up, hol' up, lil', hol' up, lil' bitch)</span>
<span>Be humble (hol' up, bitch)</span>
<span>Sit down (hol' up, sit down, lil', sit down, lil' bitch)</span>
<span>Be humble (hol' up, hol' up)</span>
<span>Bitch, sit down (hol' up, hol' up, lil' bitch)</span>
<span>Be humble (lil' bitch, hol' up, bitch)</span>
<span>Sit down (hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, hol' up)</span>

<span className='par'>[Verse 2]</span>
<span>Who dat nigga thinkin' that he frontin' on Man-Man? (Man-Man)</span>
<span>Get the fuck off my stage, I'm the Sandman (Sandman)</span>
<span>Get the fuck off my dick, that ain't right</span>
<span>I make a play fucking up your whole life</span>
<span>I'm so fuckin' sick and tired of the Photoshop</span>
<span>Show me somethin' natural like afro on Richard Pryor</span>
<span>Show me somethin' natural like ass with some stretch marks</span>
<span>Still will take you down right on your mama's couch in Polo socks</span>
<span>Ayy, this shit way too crazy, ayy, you do not amaze me, ayy</span>
<span>I blew cool from AC, ayy, Obama just paged me, ayy</span>
<span>I don't fabricate it, ayy, most of y'all be fakin', ayy</span>
<span>I stay modest 'bout it, ayy, she elaborate it, ayy</span>
<span>This that Grey Poupon, that Evian, that TED Talk, ayy</span>
<span>Watch my soul speak, you let the meds talk, ayy</span>
<span>If I kill a nigga, it won't be the alcohol, ayy</span>
<span>I'm the realest nigga after all</span>

<span className='par'>[Chorus]</span>
<span>Bitch, be humble (hol' up, bitch)</span>
